# Geometry Battle ðŸš€

This was my first ever game made in C++. It follows the [Entity Component System](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) (ECS) design. 

I learned some concepts of the ECS design, for example, how to separate logic from data, and the systems that when updated doesn't affect others. I also picked up some knowledge of C++.

It was a fun and exciting experience and yet really challenging (especially the collision Math part ðŸ˜…).

## Gameplay and Demo

![](demo.gif)

Move your character using W-S-A-D keys, shoot enemies with the primary mouse button. With the secondary a special ability is activated (rain of fire).
Killing enemies gives you points based on the number of verticies that they have. You lose points and special ability cooldown on dying.

## How to Install and run

Linux:

1. Install make, the compiler and SFML
```bash 
sudo apt install g++ build-essential libsfml-dev
```

2. Clone the repository then copy config file
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ferreouz/geometry-battle
cd geometry-battle
cp config.example.txt config.txt && mkdir bin
```

3. Download a font (the path is changed in the config.txt)
```bash
wget https://wisabo.com/system/uploads/font-files/5363/Mukta-Light.ttf && mv Mukta-Light.ttf mukta.ttf
```

4. Build and run
```bash
make
```

_OBS: I developed using Linux but can be runned in Windows as well_
